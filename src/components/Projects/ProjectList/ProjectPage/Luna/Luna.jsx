                <span className={css.sub}>LUNA (League Ukrainian News App) is a project I developed to enhance my skills with React and Node.js. The primary goal was to create an application that supports user registration, login, and smooth navigation between pages <span className={css.mark}>(React)</span> while managing most of the content through a MongoDB database and backend functionalities like user authentication <span className={css.mark}>(Node.js)</span>.</span>
                <br />
                <span className={css.sub}>Additionally, I aimed to provide a platform for translating all the latest news about the game League of Legends into Ukrainian. As the game frequently introduces updates, offline events, and esports tournaments, I wanted to make this wealth of information more accessible to the Ukrainian community in their native language.</span>
                <br />
                <span className={css.sub}>While the project didnâ€™t achieve significant success, I consider it a valuable learning experience. It taught me about hosting, optimizing for Google search engine positions, and many other nuances of web development. Currently, the project is available on GitHub as part of my portfolio.</span>
